Web technologies have always been my passion and, thankfully, that’s the path my career has taken me: from small startups all the way to Amazon. In my 16 years in the industry I have seen a lot, from web services and jQuery to streaming RESTful APIs with complex React SPAs and always but with an eye on quality and efficiency.
